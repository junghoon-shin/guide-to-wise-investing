On Feb 1, 2021, following a general election which Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (Myanmar’s ruling party) won by a landslide, Tatmadaw (Myanmar’s military forces), led by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, launched a coup d’état and seized power over the government. The armed forces claimed a “widespread fraud” had been uncovered relating to the election, but no evidence supporting the army’s claim has yet been presented. The Tatmadaw proclaimed a year-long state of emergency and detained President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi at an unknown location, along with ministers and their deputies and the members of the Parliament, declaring that power had been transferred to Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing.

The coup triggered nationwide civil resistance efforts by hundreds of thousands of protesters who demanded the release of Ms. Suu Kyi and the return of democracy. The military government responded with physical forces. Wireless internet and social media including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and WhatsApp have been shut down across the country; at least 701 protesters and bystanders have been killed; and at least 3,012 people — among them journalists, protesters, activists, government officials, trade unionists, writers, students, civilians, and even children — have been arrested by the military forces since the coup as of Apr 11 according to the [Assistance Association for Political Prisoners](https://aappb.org/).

The situation appears to keep worsening despite the rising concerns around the international community. At least 82 people were killed and many others injured in a single day in Bago in a crackdown by the security forces on Apr 9 according to reports from independent local media. All non-state-owned newspapers and five popular independent news services were forced to stop publishing and broadcasting on all platforms with their licenses revoked by the junta. The use of satellite dishes to access the international sources of news was also declared illegal by several local governments. The police raided shops selling satellite dishes and confiscated them. The fiber broadband service, the last legal way for ordinary people to access the internet, became intermittently inaccessible recently, effectively putting the whole country under a deteriorating information blackout.

One of my lifelong friends, [Oreum Kim](https://www.instagram.com/uraura_chacha_/), who had been working in Myanmar since 2017, recorded what’s been happening in the country under stratocracy since the February’s coup in a series of postcards and a photobook to share with the global community, and commenced a crowdfunding campaign to support the recovery of freedom, peace, and democracy in Myanmar. According to Oreum, the funds raised will go toward the families of activists who have been killed by the military forces during the demonstration, the local media, or the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), which represents the National League for Democracy lawmakers ousted amid the coup. Oreum (bom0605@hanmail.net) is welcoming any questions on how the raised funds will be delivered and used. More information can be found on the [crowdfunding webpage](https://www.ycrowdy.com/r/savemyanmar), also accessible via the QR code below.
