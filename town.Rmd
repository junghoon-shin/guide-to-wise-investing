## Charlie Munger's four principles of investing

1. It must be a business within your circle of competence.
2. The business should have [*intrinsic* characteristics](#moat) that give it a durable competitive advantage.
3. The business should have [management](#management) with integrity and talent.
4. The business should be available for a fair price that gives a "margin of safety."

## Five and a half moats {#moat}

```{r}
tibble(Moat = c("Strong brand", 
                "Painful switching<br>(Network effect)", 
                "Toll bridge<br>(Monopoly)", 
                "Secret<br>(Patent)", 
                "Price"),
