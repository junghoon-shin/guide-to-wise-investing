[["index.html", "Guide to Wise Investing Preface", " Guide to Wise Investing Junghoon Shin 2022-09-15 09:28:59 KST Preface Photo by Mathieu Stern on Unsplash When I first stepped into the investment world, there was just too much information all over the newspapers, websites, books, YouTube, and even lunch table gossips which all seemed to be of the utmost importance to me. Some believed it was the perfect time to invest in the stock market, while others insisted that the whole market was significantly overheated by repeated fiscal stimulus packages from the government and we all should prepare for the impending market crash. I was so confused that I soon gave up deciding where to invest my money on my own, and instead relied upon some random 1M-subscriber stock YouTubers, trying to copy what they were doing as closely as I could. It seemed a fairly good strategy until I read what one of the most successful investors on the planet once uttered: “Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.” It was painful because that was exactly what I was doing — I didn’t know what I was doing. From that moment on, I tried to read what the great investors wrote, collect seemingly helpful information, distinguish between useful and useless ones as best as I could, and make my own investment decision whether it was correct or not. It was not an easy task at first. As I rely heavily on Google to get my work done and get surprised by its versatility almost every day, I thought that investing in Google might be a good idea. I was smart enough to know that Alphabet Inc. was the parent company of Google, so I decided to do some research into it. All I really did was to search it up on Google. In about 0.5 seconds, Google spat out 166,000,000 results on the screen. It was not long after I scrolled down to see if anything useful was there that I totally gave up. After giving a few more tries to some other companies, I realized that there weren’t many sources of information that fit my needs exactly: something easy, concise, yet informative. After struggling for quite a while I set about working on this project. It was initially aimed to serve as my personal resource of automatically updated financial data which include only understandable and useful information that would aid me to make an unbiased and premeditated investment decision. As the project went along, however, it slowly evolved into what I thought could also help others who were interested in investing but found existing sources of information exhausting. This project is designed to help specifically those laymen who seek a reliable source of investment data that does not take a whole lot of time and professional-level financial knowledge to digest. I made my best effort to collate only information that most non-expert investors like me can easily apply to their investment practice right away. This is a free-to-use, public-access, ongoing project still in its infant stage, and I am always open to suggestions from whoever hopes to make it better. Please feel free to contact me, or even better make a pull request (click the edit button on the top left corner of the page you want to edit) anytime anywhere.

"],["author.html", "About the author", " About the author Junghoon Shin is a Korean doctor, cancer scientist, and statistical programmer. He earned his MD and MSc from the Seoul National University College of Medicine and PhD from the Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, where he conducted research primarily on the transcriptome dysregulation patterns observed in cancer cells which have a key role in the cancer development process. He completed his resident training at the Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital and earned his medical board certificate in 2018. He is currently working as a clinical fellow at Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital. More recently, he has had a particular interest in artificial intelligence, business management, and obviously, investment. He started investing when he knew almost nothing about investing. Yet everything he invested in was soaring through the sky. He had no idea why his stocks shot up and it was a shame. It turned out that he had made his first-ever investment in the biggest bull market the world has seen over the last decade: recovery from the COVID-19 crash in 2020. He was very lucky that he made many poor investment decisions without paying the price as many others do. This free lesson was only made possible thanks to Sehhoon Park, who encouraged him to start investing, told him what to read and watch, and shared with him which companies seemed good to invest in and why. This project would not have been possible without Sehhoon’s constant and genuine advice. He still has a lot to learn about investment and wants to share what he learns with as many learners like him as possible (especially with his beloved family and friends who are still on the fence about investing their cold hard cash in ticker symbols on the screen). The stock market will continue to wobble with inevitable recessions and booms as it always has done. He aspires to develop an objective resource of information that can help all investors to discern signals from noise and make the right decision based on reasoning and not on feeling. He spends most of his out-of-work time designing his project while thinking, reading, and digging out early-stage companies that have a great mission, moat, and fine management.

Rule No. 2 is never forget Rule No. 1.” 1.2 Value investing “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.” “The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage.” “Buy into a company because you want to own it, not because you want the stock to go up.” “Buy a stock the way you would buy a house. Understand and like it such that you’d be content to own it in the absence of any market.” 1.3 Investing for the long term “Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.” “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for ten years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes.” “All there is to investing is picking good stocks at good times and staying with them as long as they remain good companies.” “Do not take yearly results too seriously. Instead, focus on four or five-year averages.” 1.4 Dealing with losing investments “The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.” 1.5 Right mindset for investing “We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.” “It is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results.” “The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.” “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” “Chains of habits are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken.” 1.6 Market crashes and recessions “In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.” “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s been swimming naked.” “Predicting rain doesn’t count, building the ark does.” 1.7 Importance of learning “I just sit in my office and read all day.” “Read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.” “I insist on a lot of time being spent, almost every day, to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business.” “One can best prepare themselves for the economic future by investing in your own education. If you study hard and learn at a young age, you will be in the best circumstances to secure your future.” “Never invest in a business you cannot understand.” “Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.” 1.8 Ignoring market noise “The most important quality for an investor is temperament, not intellect. You need a temperament that neither derives great pleasure from being with the crowd nor against the crowd.” “You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right.” “We’ve long felt that the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good. Even now, Charlie and I continue to believe that short-term market forecasts are poison and should be kept locked up in a safe place, away from children and also from grown-ups who behave in the market like children.” “Don’t get caught up with what other people are doing. Being a contrarian isn’t the key but being a crowd follower isn’t either. You need to detach yourself emotionally.” 1.9 Index funds “Among the various propositions offered to you, if you invested in a very low cost index fund — where you don’t put the money in at one time, but average in over 10 years — you’ll do better than 90% of people who start investing at the same time.” “Just pick a broad index like the S&amp;P 500. Don’t put your money in all at once; do it over a period of time.” The quotes are picked and reorganized from https://www.fool.com/investing/best-warren-buffett-quotes.aspx.↩︎ "],["2-town.html", "Chapter 2 Munger and Town’s lessons2 2.1 Charlie Munger’s four principles of investing 2.2 Five and a half moats 2.3 Big four numbers 2.4 Management numbers 2.5 Pricing methods", " Chapter 2 Munger and Town’s lessons2 2.1 Charlie Munger’s four principles of investing It must be a business within your circle of competence.

The OECD system of Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) is designed to provide early signals of turning points in business cycles - fluctuation in the output gap, i.e. fluctuation of the economic activity around its long term potential level. This approach, focusing on turning points (peaks and troughs), results in CLIs that provide qualitative rather than quantitative information on short-term economic movements. The phases and patterns in CLIs are likely to be followed by the business cycle. The chart below presents the CLI and the estimated business cycle for the OECD area. The two series show strong co-movements, with the turning points of the CLI consistently preceding those of the business cycle; lead time varies, but 6 - 9 months is at what the OECD aims. Figure 12.5: OECD area Composite Leading Indicator (CLI) and economic activity (long-term trend = 100) - OECD Do OECD CLIs predict the future movement of stock markets? The stock market is what’s known as a leading economic indicator. A leading economic indicator is a measure of economic recovery that shows improvement before the actual economy does. Stock prices are forward-looking in the sense that investors buy and sell stocks not based on what happened yesterday or what is happening today, but rather based on their expectations for the future. For example, a company may report impressive EPS and revenue numbers in a given quarter. But if they also cut revenue and EPS growth projections for the next several quarters at the same time, the stock will most certainly sell off. An individual stock is priced in large part based on investors’ expectations of what is coming in the next several months and quarters. Collectively, the S&amp;P 500 is priced in a similar fashion. - Wayne Duggan @ Benzinga.com Data are from World Bank and OECD.↩︎ "],["13-portfolio.html", "Chapter 13 My portfolio 13.1 Invested asset composition 13.2 Current and target asset allocation", " Chapter 13 My portfolio 13.1 Invested asset composition Figure 13.1: Invested asset allocation Figure 13.2: Regional distribution of invested assets Figure 13.3: Sector distribution of stock investment Figure 13.4: Bond composition 13.2 Current and target asset allocation Figure 13.5: Current and long-term target allocation of my asset "],["14-simulation.html", "Chapter 14 Asset growth simulation 14.1 Simulation in USD 14.2 Simulation in KRW", " Chapter 14 Asset growth simulation In the Shiny web application embedded below, you can freely tune your investment scenario and see how your asset will grow over time.
